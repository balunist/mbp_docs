Exporting the created map
=========================

There are several alternative :ref:`maptype-label` options that will export the created 
map in one step finishing without leaving the map in the model.  This include DXF file, SVG files or Report 
Output.  You may however wish to keep the map in order to use it in the Fusion's manufacturing workspace to
create toolpaths to produce your model.  The same exports can be done after the map has been created.
This allow the model to be rearranged if desired before an export is performed. 
        
There are a number of post-mapping tasks that can be performed on the created map object.  It is
more efficient and recommended to create the map first then execute tasks on that map.  
The tasks available include labeling, exports of SVG, DXF, Cutlist, Report and the recently added
Manufacturing Model.  A description of the tasks can be found here. 
:ref:`Post-Mapping Tasks <tasks-label>`
Be sure to try the Report task which will create an html file that includes a view of the map, 
cut-list, required materials and the MBP options selected to create the map.  Report also provides 
an output type Print which allows the report to be saved as a PDF or even rotate boards for better viewing.</p>

There are a number of options available in the Options tab.  See  `Options <https://icarussoftlandings.com/app/options/mapboardspro/>`__ 
            
Notes:
    - The arrangements accounts for the amount of **component spacing** and **trim on board** 
      specified in options.  Minimize their size for tighter arrangements.
    - You can move components within or between boards in the resulting arranged map.
      :ref:`Rearranging Map <rearrangemap-label>` 
    - Rearranged maps can be relabeled or exported with the Post-Mapping tasks
