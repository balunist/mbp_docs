Save as Defaults
================

Pressing this button will save the current option selections as global defaults. It will also save the current 
dimension settings for board types (Material Type / Thickness) on the lumber tab.

Being saved globally means when you run MapBoards for the first time on any model the options will be initialized 
with these values and matching boards types will be initialized with these dimensions. It will also persist when 
version updates are installed.

Be aware that options and board dimensions are saved locally to the model and when you rerun MapBoards Pro the local 
settings will override the global settings.
