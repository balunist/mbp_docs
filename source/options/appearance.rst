Use Appearance
==============

.. role:: blue

When :blue:`Use Appearance` is selected all parts in the model are sorted by appearance and thickness instead 
of the default physical material type and the board type list title will indicate (Appearance). When maps are 
created, parts are placed on the corresponding board types (appearance/thickness).  

This can be very powerful since users can create their own named appearances enabling the sub-groups arrangements.
